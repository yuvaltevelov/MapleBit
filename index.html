        <h1>The Next Generation of Cype</h1>
		<p>CypeReboot aims to fix a problem that has plagued the Maplestory Alternative Section for quite some time. Look around, you&#39;ll see that all the releases follow the same basic designs, and use the same old recycled scripts that were created three to four years ago. Four years ago, the web was a very different place. Mobile devices were starting to become popular, tablets hadn&#39;t broken into the market yet, and HTML5 and CSS3 had barely entered the scene. At this point, the Maplestory community was new, so it was understandable that the websites being used sacrificed efficiency, documentation, and cleanliness for the fact that it worked. Many of you remember the old CypeCMS. At the time (and still today, in my opinion), CypeCMS was revolutionary. It was a powerful tool with features that one would expect of a full CMS, such as blogs, comments, and profiles.
		<p>
		CypeReboot is the next generation of Cype. It may look like a reskin of Cype, but it&#39;s completely different under the hood. It uses MySQLi, instead of MySQL. MySQLi is especially useful for the installer, which is fully automated (using mysqli_multi_query). All you have to do is enter in your database details, and the installer will do everything else for you! Some other features that have been added include reCaptcha registration, a configurable voting script (through the admin panel), and better security throughout the CMS.
		<p>
		From the frontend of the site, Cype has been changed dramatically. Gone are the days of the crimson red table based design. I decided to use Bootstrap by Twitter for Cype. Bootstrap is a great HTML5/CSS3 framework that focuses on responsive designs that work seamlessly with mobile devices, tablets, and desktop computers. You&#39;ll find a theme changer in the administrator panel. These themes are taken from Bootswatch. At this time, you are not able to create your own theme and add it to Cype, but this functionality will be added soon.
